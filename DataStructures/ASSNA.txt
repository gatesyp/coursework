A data structure that can support the operations Insert, Max Delete and Min Delete is a vector. 
For the Delete functions, you are basically performing a search algorithm in order to find the maximum or minimum of the list, and then rearranging pointers to delete the node. 

Using a Binary Search gives an average case of O(log(n)), which is best used when number of elements in the set is greater than 8. If less than 8, performing a Linear Search would be best. After finding the element to delete, shifting all the elements down an index will give O(n).

But if the order of the array does not need to be preserved, then you can just swap the selected element with the current last element, then decrease the size of the array by 1.  

Thus the entire operation without preservation of the order takes O(nlog(n)), but with preservation would be O(log(n)). 

If the list has less than 8 elements, then the entire operation without preservation would take O(n), but with preservation would be O(n^2).
